    "## 1.3 Wavelet Filtering/Denoising\n",
    "\n",
    "Wavelets represent a significant advancement in the field of image processing, particularly for applications like ultrasound image denoising. Unlike traditional Fourier transforms, which excel in analyzing stationary signals but lack precision in time localization, wavelets offer a more dynamic approach. They provide both time and frequency information, making them especially useful for processing non-stationary signals, such as those in medical imaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of using wavelets for image denoising involves several key steps. First, the image is decomposed into a series of wavelet coefficients. This decomposition breaks down the image into different levels of detail, allowing for a multi-resolution analysis. In the denoising phase, these wavelet coefficients are carefully examined and manipulated. Typically, smaller coefficients, which are often associated with noise, are reduced or eliminated, while the larger coefficients, representing important features of the image, are preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the image is reconstructed from these modified wavelet coefficients. This reconstruction is crucial as it ensures that while noise is reduced, essential details and edges in the image are retained. The ability of wavelets to adapt to different scales and features of the signal makes them particularly effective in preserving the integrity of important structures in ultrasound images, a critical aspect in medical diagnostics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wavelet Families\n",
    "\n",
    "Haar Wavelets: The simplest and earliest form of wavelets, known for their simplicity and efficiency. They are particularly useful for quick analysis but may not be ideal for capturing finer details in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Daubechies Wavelets: Named after Ingrid Daubechies, these wavelets are widely used due to their ability to compactly represent signals with many zeros. They are excellent for denoising and are often used in medical image processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Symlets: Similar to Daubechies, Symlets are slightly modified to be more symmetric. This symmetry makes them more suitable for applications where phase distortion is a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coiflets: Designed to achieve higher degrees of smoothness, Coiflets are useful for detecting and preserving features such as edges in images."
